## Sync

A synchronization experiment inspired by the book "Sync: How Order Emerges
From Chaos In the Universe, Nature, and Daily Life" by Steven H. Strogatz.

Each cell flashes roughly once every two seconds. The cells
influence each other in such a way that they all eventually synchronize,
similar to firing neurons or synchronizing fireflies.
